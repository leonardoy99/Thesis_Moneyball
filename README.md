# Attack wins you games, defence wins you titles. A Moneyball approach to assess the importance of defenders in football. 
The aim of this research is to examine whether there is supporting evidence for the importance of defensive players in football compared to offensive ones, and then assess if the salary market efficiently rewards their performances. To win a game, not conceding a goal is as important as scoring one. Nonetheless, there is a well-established tradition in which forwards tend to be valued much more than defenders.
To address the goal of the study, we attempt to measure player performance by using the VAEP (Valuing Actions by Estimating Probabilities) framework. Estimates of the probability of scoring and conceding a goal are computed after each action, thus assigning an individual contribution to each player. In this regard, actions are represented through SPADL (Soccer Player Action Description Language), which describes each of them as a set of features. Then probabilities are estimated by a classification model trained on past matches.
Finally, we present a comparison between the most impactful defenders and forwards in the 5 major European football leagues according to our model, along with an overview of the efficiency of players playing in these two positions.
